An analog clock is a type of clock that displays the time using moving hands to point to numbers arranged in a circle. An analog clock can be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by following these steps:




-> HTML: Create a basic structure of the clock with a div element for the clock face and three span elements for the hour, minute, and second hands. Give each element an id or a class to style and manipulate them later.

-> CSS: Style the clock face and the hands using properties such as width, height, border, border-radius, transform, and transition. Use pseudo-elements to create the clock center and the markings for the numbers. Use colors and box-shadow to create a realistic effect.

-> JavaScript: Use the Date object to get the current hour, minute, and second values. Calculate the rotation angles for each hand based on the time values. Use the transform property to rotate the hands according to the angles. Use the setInterval function to update the time and the rotation every second.
